#### For italic we have to use single astric(*) symbol at starting and at end.

#### Example - *This line is italic*

#### For bold we have to use double astric(*) symbol at starting and at end.

#### Example - **This line is bold**

#### We could attach link for that we just have to use square brackets[] and inside that we have to type link and beside that use normal brackets() and type the link inside of it

#### Example- [link](http://google.com)
