/* NOTES */

/*
What is @layers?
The @layer directive helps you control declaration order by automatically relocating your styles to the corresponding @tailwind directive, and also enables features like modifiers and tree-shaking for your own custom CSS.

For more power, you can also use the @layer directive to add styles to Tailwindâ€™s base, components, and utilities layers:



base - The base layer is for things like reset rules or default styles applied to plain HTML elements.

components - The components layer is for class-based styles that you want to be able to override with utilities.

utilities - The utilities layer is for small, single-purpose classes that should always take precedence over any other styles.
